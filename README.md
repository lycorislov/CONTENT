     ‼️➡️ ATTENTION ; Many linked resources below have donations available  for more than one country. (EX: irusa, rescue.org, crisisrelief.un.org, etc.) I will work on a section that better organizes multi-focused websites. This page is additionally still a MAJOR WIP and will continue to be updated regularly when I am able to as I figure GitHub and Rentry out! I am welcome to suggestions, reccomendations and info about any sources. If you have any other topics that you think should be added, feel free to let me know. Please note that I do not use this GitHub to stirr discourse or arguments, and I simply wish to educate and inform.
